Forked from http://javascriptsoapclient.codeplex.com/ and modified by gtathub.

Improvements

* Arrays are also parsed out of responses if they aren't listed in the wsdl
* Understands responses from php webservice (for example Magento)
* IE9 compatible

Tested

Please leave me a note if you have tested other webservices or found bugs.
